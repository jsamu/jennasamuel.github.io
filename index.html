									<h1>Hello!</h1>
									<p>
										My name is Jenna Samuel and I'm a Ph.D. candidate studying astrophysics at the 
										University of California, Davis. I use cosmological simulations to understand 
										what the distribution and dynamics of satellite dwarf galaxies can tell us about 
										their formation and evolution within the host environment. My research focuses on 
										satellites of our own galaxy, the Milky Way, and those of the neighboring 
										galaxy, Andromeda.

									I use hydrodynamic zoom-in simulations of Milky Way-like galaxies 
									from the FIRE (Feedback In Realistic Environments) project to learn about 
									our local cosmological environment. These simulations start 
									out at high redshift (early times) with only dark matter 
									which is then perturbed according to Cosmic Microwave Background 
									constraints. The simulation is evolved to today, at which point 
									a Milky Way-like dark matter halo is chosen for re-simulation at higher 
									(“zoom-in”) resolution with dark matter, stars, and gas.
									The last few billions of years in one such similation can be seen in the movie below.

									My first paper, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.11508">A profile in FIRE</a>, 
									explores the radial distribution of satellite galaxies around both isolated 
									Milky Way-like galaxies and paired Local Group-like systems in the FIRE 
									simulations. Radial distributions of satellites are important because they can test our 
									models of galaxy formation against observations of our own cosmological neighborhood. 
									The clustering of satellites towards their host galaxy is also important in studies 
									of spatial and kinematic coherence of satellites, such as the satellite plane problem.
									I wrote a <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.11508">Twitter thread</a> that explains 
									the key results from this project.
								</p>

								<p>
									I am presently investigating the problem of satellite planes using simulations. 
									The satellite plane problem is the spatial and kinematic coherence of satellite dwarf
									galaxies in a planar or disk-like structure around the Milky Way, Andromeda, and Centaurus A. 
									Previous studies that have looked for such planes in simulations have largely come 
									up empty handed, implying that maybe what we observe around the Milky Way may be 
									exceedingly rare.

									Soon, I will be working on a project that ties the orbits of satellites 
									to their star formation history and gas content evolution. Specifically, I want to 
									disentangle the roles of internal stellar feedback (supernovae, stellar winds, and 
									photoionization pressure and heating) and external halo environment (hot, pressure-supported 
									gas in the Milky Way’s halo exerting ram pressure stripping) in regulating the gas 
									content and star formation of satellites.
								</p>

								<p>
									In the past I have done research on accreting supermassive black holes at the centers 
									of galaxies, called active galactic nuclei (AGN). For this research I used the 
									technique of reverberation mapping (RM), measuring the time lag in variability coming 
									from an AGN at different wavelengths or energies. I used broad line RM where 
									the time lag was measured between V band continuum luminosity and H-beta broad line 
									emission. As an undergraduate, my first research experience was at Thomas Jefferson 
									National Laboratory through the Science Undergraduate Laboratory Internship (SULI) 
									program. I worked to characterize the properties of multi-anode photomultiplier tubes 
									that were used in a ring-imaging Cherenkov detector.

									<h2>Outreach & Teaching</h2>
								</header>
								<p>
									Since late 2017 I have been a member of the UC Davis Diversity and 
									Inclusion in Physics (DIP) group. We meet weekly to discuss issues of equity 
									within our department and brainstorm ideas to remedy them that we then 
									communicate to our faculty. You can find diversity, equity, and inclusion 
									resources on our website, <a href="https://davisdip.wordpress.com/">Davis DIP</a>.
								</p>

								<p>
									Once a month I help put on a local public astronomy event called 
									Astronomy on Tap at Sudwerk Brewery in Davis. It features two short 
									talks by astronomers and short segments about current events in astronomy. 
									The event always draws a crowd of all ages and gives me a chance to 
									answer people’s questions and let them know what goes on in their 
									local physics and astronomy department.
								</p>

								<p>
									In 2018, I organized a graduate student study group that strove to 
									further a broad scientific understanding of astronomy while providing 
									necessary professional development experiences like presentations, 
									CV writing, and website building. 
									Our biweekly meetings were peer-led and helped us learn about 
									each other’s research in detail, discuss review articles, or peer review
									fellowship application materials.
								</p>
									
								<p>
									As a graduate student I have been a Teaching Assistant for introductory 
									physics labs (both mechanics and electromagnetism). I have also acted as 
									Course TA for lectures in introductory astronomy, physics for non-science 
									majors, and upper division math methods for physics majors. All of these 
									roles included time spent grading and giving feedback to students, as well 
									as leading office hours and lab sections.
								</p>
									
								<p>
									As an undergraduate at Florida International University I participated in 
									the Learning Assistant program. This was my first teaching experience and 
									I helped facilitate introductory physics (mechanics) labs for two years 
									before moving on to helping run the modern physics labs and lecture. There 
									I helped students run and understand some of the most pivotal physics 
									experiments of the 20th century, from demonstrating the photoelectric effect 
									to the double-slit experiment.
