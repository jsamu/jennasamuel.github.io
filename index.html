									<h1>Hello!</h1>
									<p>
										My name is Jenna Samuel. I am a Ph.D. candidate in astrophysics at the 
										University of California, Davis. My research focuses on how the 
										dynamics of satellite dwarf galaxies impact their formation history. I am 
										particularly interested in understanding the satellites of our own galaxy, 
										the Milky Way, and those of the neighboring galaxy, Andromeda. I use 
										cosmological zoom-in simulations to understand the possible dynamical 
										origins of observed satellite properties. Currently, I am addressing the 
										satellite plane problem common to both the Milky Way and Andromeda using 
										the Latte simulations as part of the FIRE2 suite. My future work includes 
										plans to understand the relative roles of internal stellar feedback vs. 
										external halo environment on the star formation and gas content of satellite 
										dwarf galaxies.

									I use simulations of galaxies to understand our own galaxy, the Milky Way. 
									The particular simulations that I use (the Latte simulations) are part of 
									the FIRE (Feedback In Realistic Environments) project, which is a suite of 
									fully cosmological hydrodynamic zoom-in simulations. These simulations start 
									out at high redshift (early times) with only low resolution dark matter 
									particles which are perturbed according to Cosmic Microwave Background 
									constraints. The simulation is evolved to redshift 0 (today), at which point 
									a Milky Way-like dark matter halo is chosen for re-simulation at higher 
									resolution (“zoom-in” simulation) with dark matter, star particles, and 
									hydrodynamical gas particles.

									I have recently submitted a paper, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.11508">A profile in FIRE</a>, 
									that explores the radial distribution of satellite galaxies around both isolated 
									Milky Way-like galaxies and paired Local Group-like systems in cosmological 
									simulations. Radial distributions are important because they allow us to test our 
									models of galaxy formation against observations in our cosmological neighborhood. 
									The radial concentration, or how clustered satellites are towards their host galaxy, 
									is also important in studies of spatial and kinematic coherence of satellites, such 
									as the satellite plane problem.
								</p>

								<p>
									<span class="image left"><img src="images/enclosing_angle_doodle.JPG" alt="" /></span>
									My current work is aimed at investigating the problem of satellite planes 
									in simulations. The satellite plane problem is the apparent spatial and kinematic 
									coherence of the Milky Way’s satellites in a rotating plane or disk structure. 
									Previous studies that have looked for such planes in simulations have largely come 
									up empty handed, implying that maybe what we observe around the Milky Way is 
									exceedingly rare. My work on the subject seeks to disentangle the prevalence of a 
									planar structure from other biasing characteristics of the satellite distribution 
									such as radial concentration.

									In the future, I will be working on a project that ties the dynamics of satellites 
									to their formation history. Specifically, I want to disentangle the roles of internal 
									stellar feedback (supernovae, stellar winds, and photoionization pressure and heating) 
									and external halo environment (hot, pressure-supported gas in the Milky Way’s halo 
									exerting ram pressure stripping) in regulating the gas content and star formation of 
									satellites.
								</p>

								<p>
									In the past I have done research on accreting supermassive black holes at the centers 
									of galaxies, called active galactic nuclei (AGN). For this research I used the 
									technique of reverberation mapping (RM), measuring the time lag in variability coming 
									from an AGN at different wavelengths/energies. In particular, I used broad line RM where 
									the time lag was measured between V band continuum luminosity and H-beta broad line 
									emission. As an undergraduate, my first research experience was at Thomas Jefferson 
									National Laboratory through the Science Undergraduate Laboratory Internship (SULI) 
									program. I worked to characterize the properties of multi-anode photomultiplier tubes 
									that were to be used in a ring-imaging Cherenkov detector.

									<h2>Outreach & Teaching</h2>
								</header>
								<p>
									Since late 2017 I have been a member of the UC Davis Diversity and 
									Inclusion in Physics (DIP) group. We meet weekly to discuss issues of equity 
									within our department and brainstorm ideas to remedy them that we then 
									communicate to our faculty. You can find diversity, equity, and inclusion 
									resources on our website, <a href="https://davisdip.wordpress.com/">Davis DIP</a>.

									Once a month I help put on a local public astronomy event called 
									Astronomy on Tap at Sudwerk Brewery in Davis. It features two short 
									talks by astronomers and short segments about current events in astronomy. 
									The event always draws a crowd of all ages and gives me a chance to 
									answer people’s questions and let them know what goes on in their 
									local physics and astronomy department.

									In 2018, I organized a graduate student study group that strove to 
									further a broad scientific understanding of astronomy while providing 
									necessary professional development experiences like presentations, 
									CV writing, and website building. 
									Our biweekly meetings were peer-led and helped us learn about 
									each other’s research in detail, discuss review articles, or peer review
									fellowship application materials.
								</p>
									
								<p>
									As a graduate student I have been a Teaching Assistant for introductory 
									physics labs (both mechanics and electromagnetism). I have also acted as 
									Course TA for lectures in introductory astronomy, physics for non-science 
									majors, and upper division math methods for physics majors. All of these 
									roles included time spent grading and giving feedback to students, as well 
									as leading office hours and lab sections.
									
									As an undergraduate at Florida International University I participated in 
									the Learning Assistant program. This was my first teaching experience and 
									I helped facilitate introductory physics (mechanics) labs for two years 
									before moving on to helping run the modern physics labs and lecture. There 
									I helped students run and understand some of the most pivotal physics 
									experiments of the 20th century, from demonstrating the photoelectric effect 
									to the double-slit experiment.
