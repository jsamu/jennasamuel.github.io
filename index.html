									<h1>Hello!</h1>
									<p>
										My name is Jenna Samuel and I'm a Ph.D. candidate in astrophysics at 
										UC Davis. I use cosmological simulations to study satellite galaxies.
										I focus on understanding what the distribution 
										and dynamics of satellite dwarf galaxies around Milky Way-like host galaxies 
										can tell us about their formation and evolution within their host's environment.

									<b>Intro:</b>
									I use hydrodynamic zoom-in simulations of Milky Way-like galaxies 
									from the FIRE (Feedback In Realistic Environments) project to learn about 
									our local cosmological environment. The simulations start with just dark matter 
									which is perturbed according to Cosmic Microwave Background 
									constraints. The simulation is then evolved to today, at which point 
									a Milky Way-like dark matter halo is chosen for re-simulation at 
									high resolution with dark matter, stars, and gas. 
									You can see the last few billions of years of one of these similations 
									in the movie below.
									
				
								</p>
								
								<p><b>Current and future work:</b>
									I am investigating the problem of satellite planes using simulations. 
									The satellite plane problem is the spatial and kinematic coherence of satellite dwarf
									galaxies in a planar or disk-like structure around the Milky Way, Andromeda, and Centaurus A. 
									Previous studies that have looked for such planes in simulations have largely come 
									up empty handed, implying that maybe what we observe around the Milky Way may be 
									exceedingly rare.

									Soon, I will be working on a project that ties the orbits of satellites 
									to their star formation history and gas content evolution. Specifically, I want to 
									disentangle the roles of internal stellar feedback (supernovae, stellar winds, and 
									photoionization pressure and heating) and external halo environment (hot, pressure-supported 
									gas in the Milky Way’s halo exerting ram pressure stripping) in regulating the gas 
									content and star formation of satellites.
								</p>
								<p><b>Past work:</b>
									My first paper, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.11508">A profile in FIRE</a>, 
									explores the radial distribution of satellite galaxies around both isolated 
									Milky Way-like galaxies and paired Local Group-like systems in the FIRE 
									simulations. Radial distributions of satellites are important because they can test our 
									models of galaxy formation against observations of our own cosmological neighborhood. 
									The clustering of satellites towards their host galaxy is also important in studies 
									of spatial and kinematic coherence of satellites, such as the satellite plane problem.
									I wrote a <a href="https://twitter.com/astro_jenna/status/1122900978942926848">Twitter thread</a> that explains 
									the key results from this project.
								</p>
								<p>
									I have also done research on accreting supermassive black holes at the centers 
									of galaxies, called active galactic nuclei (AGN). For this research I used the 
									technique of reverberation mapping (RM), measuring the time lag in variability coming 
									from an AGN at different wavelengths or energies. I used broad line RM where 
									the time lag was measured between V band continuum luminosity and H-beta broad line 
									emission. As an undergraduate, my first research experience was at Thomas Jefferson 
									National Laboratory through the Science Undergraduate Laboratory Internship (SULI) 
									program. I worked to characterize the properties of multi-anode photomultiplier tubes 
									that were used in a Cherenkov detector.

									<h2>Service, Outreach, & Teaching</h2>
								</header>
								<p>
									<b>Service:</b> I have been an active member of the UC Davis Diversity and 
									Inclusion in Physics (DIP) group since 2017. We meet weekly to discuss issues of equity 
									within our department and brainstorm ideas to remedy them that we then 
									communicate to our faculty and implement together. You can find diversity, equity, and inclusion 
									resources on our website, <a href="https://davisdip.wordpress.com/">Davis DIP</a>.

									I also help organize a graduate student study group that strives to 
									further a broad scientific understanding of astronomy while providing 
									necessary professional development experiences like presentations, 
									CV writing, and website building. 
									Our biweekly meetings were peer-led and helped us learn about 
									each other’s research in detail, discuss review articles, or peer review
									fellowship application materials.
								</p>
								
								<p>
									<b>Outreach:</b> Once a month I help put on a local public astronomy event called 
									Astronomy on Tap at Sudwerk Brewery in Davis. It features two short 
									talks by astronomers and short segments about current events in astronomy. 
									The event always draws a crowd of all ages and gives me a chance to 
									answer people’s questions and let them know what goes on in their 
									local physics and astronomy department. I've given a talk to local high
									school girls about galaxy simulations and my experience in academia, and I've
									been part of science demonstrations for local elementary school children.
								</p>
									
								<p>
									<b>Teaching:</b> I taught intro physics online in Spring 2020 as the instructor of record, for which I 
									designed both recorded and live lectures and engaging online assignments. 
									I have also been a Teaching Assistant for undergraduate
									physics and astronomy labs, a physics for non-science 
									majors lecture, and upper division math methods for physics majors. All of these 
									roles included time spent grading and giving feedback to students, as well 
									as leading office hours and lab sections.

									I was a Learning Assistant as an undergraduate at Florida International University. 
									This was my first teaching experience and 
									I helped facilitate introductory physics labs for two years 
									before moving on to the upper division modern physics labs and lecture. There, 
									I helped students run and understand some of the most pivotal physics 
									experiments of the 20th century, from demonstrating the photoelectric effect 
									to the double-slit experiment.
