                            <p>Starting in January 2018, I have been organizing a graduate student study group that strives to further a broad scientific understanding of astronomy while providing necessary professional development experiences like presentations, CV writing, and website building. Our biweekly meetings are peer-led and may find us learning about each other’s research in detail, discussing review articles, or going through our fellowship application materials and giving each other feedback on them.</p>
                            <h3>Outreach</h3>
							<p>Once a month I help put on a local public astronomy event called Astronomy on Tap at Sudwerk Brewery in Davis. It features two short talks by astronomers and short segments about current events in astronomy. The event always draws a crowd of all ages and gives me a chance to answer people’s questions and let them know what goes on in their local physics and astronomy department.</p>
							<p>Since October 2017 I have been a member of the UC Davis Diversity and Inclusion in Physics group. We meet weekly to discuss issues of equity within our department and brainstorm ideas to remedy them that we then communicate to our faculty. You can find diversity, equity, and inclusion resources on our website, which I recently rebuilt.</p>
                            <h3>Teaching</h3>
                            <p>As a graduate student I have been a Teaching Assistant for introductory physics labs (both mechanics and electromagnetism). I have also acted as Course TA for lectures in introductory astronomy, physics for non-science majors, and upper division math methods for physics majors. All of these roles included time spent grading and giving feedback to students, as well as leading office hours and lab sections.</p>
                            <p>As an undergraduate at Florida International University I participated in the Learning Assistant program. This was my first teaching experience and I helped facilitate introductory physics (mechanics) labs for two years before moving on to helping run the modern physics labs and lecture. There I helped students run and understand some of the most pivotal physics experiments of the 20th century, from demonstrating the photoelectric effect to the double-slit experiment.</p>
